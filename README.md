Attempt at solving the order prediction problem from the Gatech Home Depot Deep Learning Hackathon in Spring 2017 using KNN in Tensorflow.

## Problem Description

It is useful to be able to predict the number of sales a given product will have given time-series information about the sales of previous days. 

## Solution Description
Despite the fact that it is not a Deep Learning solution, we attempted a K Nearest Neighbors approach using Tensorflow that grouped based on how similar prior days were. Unfortunately, accuracy was not very high, causing us to abandon the project.
